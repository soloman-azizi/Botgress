Botgress social media application

Botgress is a browser based application that helps brands and users automate their activity on instagram by mimicing actions a real user would take
this includes liking, commenting, and following other users. 

Currently the application is set to only like other users content based off of specified hashtags. The application has been developed in python and
botgress is just the node.js equivalent, while also introducing connectivity to a MongoDB database, and a UI Client that makes HTTP requests to and
from a web server developed using Express.js.

This tool is only meant to be used to supplement those who already are active on the social media platform.
